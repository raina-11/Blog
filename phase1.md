### Phase 1

I have gone through the previous year's code and tested it on some videos. I have seen the videos manually and found some of the anchors are accurately identified and some of them are misinterpreted. So there is some problem in clustering itself, so as discussed with the mentor we decided to explore multiple options in order to segment the videos. So In the beginning Iâ€™m trying some shot boundary methods.
